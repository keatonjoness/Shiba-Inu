    <h1>The Creation of Shiba Inu </h1>
    <p> One coin that has become prominent in the past year seems more
        unclear, like an inside joke about an inside joke. Shiba Inu coin, created in
        August 2020 by an anonymous person calling themselves Ryoshi, is billed as an alternative
        to Dogecoin, which itself was created as a lighthearted option to Bitcoin. </p>

    <h2> <strong>The Meme Coin!!! </strong> </h2>
    <p>The China-based cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu, which was modeled as a “fun” crypto dogecoin <br>
        has been drawing increasing attention among crypto enthusiasts looking for the next buzzy <br>
        asset to ride to the moon. Shiba saw its value surge, along with dogecoin, back in the spring <br>
        as investors sought new meme prospects.
